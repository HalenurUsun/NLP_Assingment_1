# Spam Detection System: A Hybrid Approach Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Technical Report - December 2024

## Executive Summary
This report details the implementation of a spam detection system that combines traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches. The system utilizes both content-based features and domain analysis to achieve robust spam classification performance. We implement and compare two different models: a Complement Naive Bayes classifier and a Two-Layer Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Overview
The system consists of three main components:
1. Email Domain Analysis
2. Text Processing and Feature Extraction
3. Classification Models (Naive Bayes and Neural Network)

### 1.2 Feature Engineering
The system implements several feature extraction methods:

**Domain-based Features:**
- Analysis of email domains against known legitimate/spam domains
- Pattern matching for suspicious domain characteristics
- Domain reputation scoring (0-1 scale)

**Text-based Features:**
- Text length and word count statistics
- Average word length
- Unique word ratio
- TF-IDF transformed word frequencies

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 Email Analysis Component
The EmailAnalyzer class provides:
- Synthetic email generation for training
- Domain scoring mechanism
- Pattern-based suspicious domain detection
- Pre-defined lists of legitimate and spam domains

### 2.2 Text Processing Pipeline
The TextProcessor class implements:
- Text normalization
- Stop word removal
- Lemmatization
- Feature extraction
- TF-IDF transformation

### 2.3 Model Architectures

**Naive Bayes Model:**
- Implementation: ComplementNB
- Alpha parameter: 0.5
- Designed for imbalanced datasets
- MinMaxScaler for feature normalization

**Neural Network (MLP):**
```
Layer 1: Dense(128, ReLU) + BatchNorm + Dropout(0.3)
Layer 2: Dense(64, ReLU) + BatchNorm + Dropout(0.2)
Output: Dense(1, Sigmoid)
```

## 3. Training Process

### 3.1 Data Preparation
- Feature scaling:
  - MinMaxScaler for Naive Bayes
  - StandardScaler for Neural Network
- Train-test split: 80-20
- Stratified sampling for balanced class distribution
- Class weight calculation for imbalanced data handling

### 3.2 Training Configuration

**Neural Network Training:**
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss: Binary Cross-entropy
- Batch size: 32
- Maximum epochs: 50
- Early stopping patience: 5
- Learning rate reduction factor: 0.5

**Naive Bayes Training:**
- 5-fold cross-validation
- Class weight adjustment
- Feature normalization

## 4. Evaluation Framework

### 4.1 Metrics
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision-Recall Curves

### 4.2 Visualization
- ROC curves
- Precision-Recall curves
- Confusion matrices
- Training history plots (for Neural Network)
